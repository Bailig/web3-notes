# Ethereum Block Time

Mining

- look for hash (a hexadecimal number) that is less than some target number.

Block time

- time to find the number less than some target number.

The target number is adjusted over time after every block is calculated.

- if the block time is large, the target number is raised to make mining faster.
- if the block time is small, the target number is lowered to make mining slower.
